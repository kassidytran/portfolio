            <h2>Starting Off With Assumptions</h2>
            <p>We started by making assumptions about travelers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>They struggle to find accurate travel recommendations online </li>
                <li>They need encouragement to explore local spots</li>
                <li>They want to share their favorite spots to visit with others on social media</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These initial assumptions led us to what we believed was the problem:</p>
            <div class="highlight">
                <p class="problem-statement">How might we create a social media platform that encourages travelers to explore local destinations with visual information?</p>
            </div>
            <p>Jumping on the trends at the time, our team originally proposed to present locational information to travelers via user-generated short-form video content.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Our Users</h2>
            <p>Based on our assumptions, we believed our target users were aspiring travel content creators and adventurous social media users. In order to validate these assumptions, we jumped into user research.</p>
            <div class="two-columns">
                <div class="column">
                    <h3>Target Users</h3>

                        <li>People who have traveled before or have experience using online review platforms</li>

                <div class="column">
                    <h3>Research Methods</h3>

            <p> It only took five user interviews and additional survey responses for us to discover major issues with our defined problem space. </p>

                        <h3>#2 - Users voiced concerns about safety and privacy </h3>
                        <p>"I don't really check out different places solo…safety is one of the biggest concerns for most women…." </p>
                        <p>- Female, age 22</p>

            <h2>Redefining The Problem</h2>
            <p>Our mistake was making assumptions about the user before conducting appropriate user research. Users had more issues with the trustworthiness of recommendations rather than the need for recommendations.</p>
            <div class="highlight">

                    <h3># 1 - Improve trust in Yelp reviews</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Yelp is the most used review app among survey participants</li>
                        <li>Yelp’s interface can be difficult to navigate when searching for friends</li>
                        <li>20% of Yelp reviews are reportedly fake or inaccurate</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="design-goals">
                    <h3>#2 - Increase appeal to a younger demographic</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Majority of Yelp’s user base is age 35+</li>
                        <li>Younger generations (Gen Z) are more likely to trust “word of mouth” recommendations over online reviews</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h3>Integrating Existing Social Relationships In Our Design</h3>
            <p>We planned to take advantage of our users’ social relationships. Usually, people share similar preferences to their friends - by knowing their friends’ likes and dislikes, users can form more accurate expectations of how they themselves will feel about a business. By allowing users to read  their friends' words, we can improve trust in reviews.</p>
            <p>Our behavioral archetypes were iterated to reflect our users’ needs and the company’s goals:</p>
            <div class="case-study-article-img">

                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>Three features we prioritized as necessary to improve the user experience of the app included - </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Establishing a clear path to view friends’ Yelp activity</li>
                <li>Simplifying the user flow for finding and adding friends</li>
                <li>Providing privacy options so users have autonomy over post visibility</li>

            <h2>Prototyping and Testing</h2>
            <h3>Redesigned Menu Bar</h3>
            <p>We re-organized the bottom navigation menu, replacing the “More” menu item with a “Community” menu item. The contents under the previous “More” menu item were moved to the profile page. This adds a clear, easily noticeable pathway to the social page of the app.</p>

            <h3>Designing New Community Page</h3>
            <p>Our new “Community” page was divided into two sections: an “Activity” section and “Talk” section.</p>

                </figure>

            <h3>Privacy Settings For Reviews</h3>
            <div class="case-study-article-img-mockup">

                    <img class="mockup" src="media/yelp-community/writing-review.png">
                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>A key design decision was adding privacy for reviews. Many users mentioned that they preferred to post just for their close friends and family rather than for strangers, so we added an option for adjusting review visibility. The intent behind this design was to encourage and incentivize users to post more frequently, without the need to worry about strangers who might read their posts. </p>
            <p>A review that is marked private before posting will be seen only by friends of the user, and the star rating will not contribute to the businesses public star rating.</p>
            <h3>Simplifying User Flow for Adding Friends</h3>
            <div class="case-study-article-img-mockup">
                <figure>
                    <img src="media/yelp-community/profile.png">

                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>The user flow to add friends was also modified to include less clicks. Now, each user has their own unique username. Users can add friends by going to their profile page and clicking on the + icon, then search their friends’ usernames to add them. This method of searching by username is more efficient and intuitive to seasoned social media users, compared to the current process, in which users needed to search by first name and last initial, then filter by city.</p>

            <h2>User Testing and Next Steps</h2>
            <p>When testing our prototype, we found success in that users felt:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reviews were more trustworthy</li>
                <li>More incentive to write reviews</li>
                <li>User interface of the app was more efficient to navigate</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, there were also a few areas for improvement:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The name“Community” was too ambiguous - some users found the content on the page unexpected</li>
                <li>Add friends was not communicated clearly - iconography must be updated for clarity and this function should be included on multiple pages including the Community page</li>
                <li>Some users initially clicked on the search bar on the home page to search for friends’ reviews - highlighting friends’ reviews in search results may be an interesting direction to explore in future iterations</li>

            <h2>Learning Opportunities</h2>
            <p>As my first UX design challenge, I learned many crucial lessons about the design process and moving on from failures. While my team and I initially started off by defining the problem and ideating solutions before doing adequate research, we realized that we needed to take a step back to analyze user insights and redefine our problem space. Listening to our users led us back on track to designing a solution that would actually target users’ pain points.</p>
            <p>Likewise, I also learned a lot about designing a product from a business standpoint. While it is important to consider the user’s perspective, my team and I also needed to consider the costs and benefits of this design to Yelp as a company.
