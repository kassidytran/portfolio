            <h2>Design Sprint</h2>
            <p>My team and I started off with a one-week design sprint. We each conducted a cognitive walkthrough of the <a href="https://ui.nv.gov/">Nevada Unemployment Insurance Claim Filing System (UINV) website</a>, taking note of major usability issues:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cognitive overload due to overwhelming amount of links and texts</li>
                <li>Poor hierarchal distinction between content makes the site difficult to navigate</li>
                <li>Poor legibility due to small text size and harsh contrasting colors</li>
                <li>Unwelcoming user experience due to dark color palette</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="case-study-article-img">

            </div>
            <p>To avoid bias in our assessments, we interviewed two users who have previously filed for unemployment. Both users mentioned feeling stressed during unemployment and wanting to talk to someone who can help.</p>

            </div>
            <h3>Our Solution</h3>
            <p>Based on user research insights, we proposed a chatbot as a solution to users‚Äô frustrations over a full website redesign. This design decision was made considering the following factors: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cost-effective solution</strong> - Less expensive to implement and can act as a temporary solution for users until enough funds are gathered for a full website redesign</li>
                <li><strong>Minimalistic tool for navigation</strong> - Allows users to navigate the website without a complete information architecture redesign</li>
                <li><strong>Highlighting important information</strong> - Reduce distraction for users so they can focus on completing their intended goals</li>
                <li><strong>Timeliness and accessibility of assistance</strong> - Can quickly answer more generalized questions and reduce traffic to call centers</li>
                <li><strong>Ease of customization</strong> - Language and content of responses can be customized to provide a specific user experience</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="case-study-article-img">

            <p>To conclude our design sprint, we created a low-fidelity prototype and asked 5 users to file an unemployment claim. 
            <p>We found that users:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Found the chatbot more efficient to use to navigate the website</li>
                <li>Wished the chatbot had more of a personality and sounded less robotic</li>
                <li>Wanted to use the chatbot to speak to a human customer service representative</li>
                <li>Preferred to use the chatbot if phone lines for the call center were busy</li>

            <h2>Mapping Out a Conversation Flow</h2>
            <p>The results of our design sprint revealed the chatbot as favorable among users. Seeing how users preferred to use the chatbot to navigate, we thought to explore the idea of having the chatbot double as the navigation.</p>
            <h3>Introducing AI</h3>
            <p>Users mentioned that they wished the chatbot felt less impersonal, so we made the decision to design with artificial intelligence (AI) in mind. An AI-chatbot could provide information to the user in a more personable manner and with more natural, ‚Äúhuman-like‚Äù language.</p>
            <p>To visualize the conversation flow between users and AI-generated responses, I first conducted a content audit of the current website content and categorized the information under different topics. Then I brainstormed potential user inputs based on categorized topics and input important information into ChatGPT to train the AI to respond accurately. I collected these generated responses and connected them into various conversation sequences.</p>

            <h2>Finding The Right Voice For Our Chatbot</h2>
            <p>Personality and delivery of information was crucial for the success of our chatbot in alleviating stress in anxious users. User attitudes towards the chatbot could differ based on the language and tone of voice used. In order to find the right voice for our chatbot, I had ChatGPT generate two responses differing by tone and conducted an A/B test with 17 different users. </p>

            <p>Because there we found more consistency in what users liked about the professional tone than the friendly tone, we made a key design decision to have our chatbot use a professional tone of voice. The long responses will be visually broken up into more easily digestible chunks of text using message bubbles. </p>
            <p>We would then communicate a friendly atmosphere through visual design to balance the more serious language.</p>

                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>We chose a bluebird as our chatbot's avatar, inspired by Nevada's state bird, and named it Carson, after Nevada's state capital. This allowed us to avoid the impersonal and robotic representation of a typical chatbot.</p>
            <p>The blue and yellow color palette communicates Carson‚Äôs trustworthiness and eagerness to help, and the rounded corners softens the design and allows Carson to appear friendlier. We also kept visual accessibility in mind when choosing easily readable fonts for the UI design. </p>
            <h3>Exploring Layouts For Chatbot Window</h3>
            <p>Compared to standard chatbot designs, we chose to enclose our chatbot in a large pop-up window. This was decided upon for a variety of reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Chatbot also acts as a navigation system for the website</li>
                <li>Poor content hierarchy of home page is distracting and contributes to cognitive overload - unlikely users will need to view the home page and use the chatbot simultaneously</li>
                <li>Improving legibility and interaction experience for users by maximizing available space for the chat window</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We designed two layouts - one for desktop and one for mobile devices. We considered responsive UI as crucial to the success of our chatbot, since we wanted to ensure maximum accessibility of our chatbot for users of any device.</p>

            <h2>Learning Opportunities</h2>
            <h3>Interface Design Principles</h3>
            <p>This case study provided an excellent opportunity to practice visual design principles, and taught me that every aspect in a visual design should be supported by a conscious design decision. Interface design is one aspect of overall user experience design that can impact the overall user experience of an app or website.</p>
            <h3>Exploring AI Tools in Design</h3>
            <p>This was the first time I was able to practice using AI in the design process. I believe that AI tools like ChatGPT are beneficial in streamlining the design process, and am looking forward to exploring other AI tools for design projects in the future.</p>
            <h3>If I had more time...</h3>
            <p>I would complete further testing of our prototype and determine whether or not our visual and conversational design acheived the goal of easing user anxiety. I'd also love to expand on the conversational design aspect of this project, and explore more ways we might be able to customize our chatbot to suit user needs. Finally, I wished that we had the opportunity to test more for accessibility of our design and better adhere to the WCAG standards.</p>
            <em><p><span style="font-weight: 600">*NOTE: As of September 2023, the UINV web page for UI claimants has undergone its own redesign, as well as added a chatbot for user support. The state followed a similar approach as my group, starting with a support chatbot, then later releasing an interface redesign. I thought it was interesting to see a solution my team came up with as a boot camp project being implemented in reality!</span></p></em>
